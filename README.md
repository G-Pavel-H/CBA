This is working code for finding Editex distance and similarity between two strings. I am implementing the Editex algorithm which is used for fuzzy/approximate string matching. Editex is the more developed version of Soundex as it shows a similarit value and coefficient unlike Soundex algorithm. Editex algorithm is perfect for name matchihng as it takes into account the pronunciation of the letter. 

In the DOCX file You can find some other matching algorithms which are deeply analyzed and explained. For the purpose of my task I have chosen Editex. The main.py file is just an example implementation and in the Editex_code.py file You may find the main working class.

Please feel free to modify and add any features or ideas if You wish too!
